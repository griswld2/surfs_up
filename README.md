# surfs_up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the average temperatures during June and December in Hawaii. It is more probable than not, that June is one of the hottest months in Hawaii and December is one of the coldest months in Hawaii.

## Results
The results of the data that we were able to query shows the following differences between June and December:

* On average, June is 4 degrees warmer than December. 
* The largest difference in temperatures was the coldest date recorded in either month. December's coldest day was 56 degrees, which is 8 degrees colder than June's.
* The standard deviation is larger in December than it is in June. This implies that there is more variance in weather weather temperatures in December than they are in June.

## Summary
In summary, the data shows that Hawaii has splendid temperatures year round. Opening a business in Hawaii that is focused on surfing and selling ice cream should be successful based off of Hawaii's terrific climate for both activities. 

Two additional queries were performed to look at Hawaii's precipitation in June and December as this is also a decisive factor. December shows a slightly higher amount of average precipitation, but both months saw very little precipitation.
